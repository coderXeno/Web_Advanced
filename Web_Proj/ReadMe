This is a website I designed using HTML, CSS, Javascript as basics. It uses Bootstrap 4 as a bonus and gives the facility of a signup form. 
I will be developing the backed of this website soon enough, so that the website redirects to the original page after a successful
registration. The website also uses a lot of interesting features like interactive links, interactive mobile type icons from
Font Awesome, Google fonts. The website is responsive as well. I would like to apologize for any mistakes I have might have made.
I am still learning and I will continue to develop more projects on the way. Thank you.
